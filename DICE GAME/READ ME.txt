This game is a fun and simple way to pass the time and provides a chance for players to test their luck. 
The game allows a maximum of two players to play. At the start of the game, the program will ask for the number of players and their names. Once the players have been registered, each player will take turns rolling the dice. 
The dice score will then be displayed, and the player with the highest score at the end of the game is declared the winner. This code uses tkinter, which is a Python library for creating GUI (Graphical User Interface) applications
