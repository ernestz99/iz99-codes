The number guessing game is a classic game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range. 
The game provides feedback to the player in the form of messages indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. 
The goal is to guess the number in as few attempts as possible.
This code uses tkinter, which is a Python library for creating GUI (Graphical User Interface) applications
